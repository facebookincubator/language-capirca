# Capirca syntax highlighting for Atom  

Adds syntax highlighting for Capirca filetypes in Atom. Capirca is an open source standard for writing vendor-neutral firewall policies as originally released by Google: https://github.com/google/capirca

## Features
After installing this package:

 - Syntax highlighting for many different term keywords, comments, network and service group definitions, accept/deny statements, and header values.
 - The following filetypes will be automatically highlighted: `.pol`, `.inc`, `.net`, and `.svc`. 
 - [Atom code snippets](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/) are included to make writing terms, network definitions, and service definitions easier.

## Installation
Simply open up settings in Atom (`Cmd-,`), go to `Install`, and search the `packages` section for `language-capirca`. It's a one click install from there.
